Jem was our most recent [sheltie](http://www.wisheltierescue.com/) who we had from April(ish) 2009 to almost August 2018. Many people knew Jem from seeing him around the Science Center during the school year. Jem was such a special dog ... very smart, incredibly loyal, and always watching over and protecting us. While he was a little snooty and ofen turned up his nose at “strangers”, he also melted your heart if he decided to give you the time of day. [Here is our entry about Jem](http://sheltiespandp.weebly.com/jem.html) that I wrote a few years ago. Jem was taken from us way too early, though we know he is now with his "grandpa owner" taking walks, sitting on the couch together, and scheming to get those chippies. RIP "poundy", I wish we would have had more time together, you were such a special little guy!!

There should be a slide show below. If not, then [see the pictures here](https://picasaweb.google.com/107081804861686762583/Jem02?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCLPWupirv9qNkgE&feat=directlink).
